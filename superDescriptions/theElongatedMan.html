            <p class="aboutText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   The Elongated Man, secret identity Randolph "Ralph" Dibney, is a member of the
   justice league with the ability to stretch himself out. He originally appeared in the comic book series
   <i>The Flash</i> in May of 1960. When he was a teenager, he was fascinated by the performances of contortionists.
   All of the famous contortionists he spoke with drank a soda called "Gingold." He learned chemistry and created
   a super-concentrated extract of the rare Yucatanian fruit, the Ginko, which is a primary ingredient of
   the body-bending beverage. This is how he acquired his elasticity.</p>
