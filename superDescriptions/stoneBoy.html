            <p class="aboutText">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Stone Boy, secret identity Dag Wentim, is a native of the planet Zwen. The people of
    Zwen evolved the ability to turn themselves to stone to get through their planet's 
    6-month long nights. Through great practice and concentration, stone boy gained the 
    ability to turn only part of his body, such as his fist, into stone. He was rejected
    by the legion of heroes and, with others who were also rejected, founded the legion
    of substitute heroes.</p>
